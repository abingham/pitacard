* SaveFileMgr needs to signal on changes...it is the only way.
* pitacard needs to flag changes at all appropriate times:
  - Card addition
  - Card deletion
  - Card edit
  - on review? Only if things change?

* add "recent files" to file menu
* if prompted to save on exit and you select "yes", the program doesn't exit
* pressing return ought to save the card being edited
* save manager isn't properly disabling menu items
* query-for-unsaved needs 'cancel' option
* stackio.save is not currently returning errors, so save_handler can't
  report anything other than success...
